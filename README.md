# 🎮 Python Mini Games Collection

This repository contains a few fun and beginner-friendly **Python games** I built while learning game logic and object-oriented programming concepts.  
Each project is written in **pure Python**, using only the built-in `turtle` and `pygame` modules (depending on the game).
